 * World average intensity from Electricity Map
 * It represents the greenhouse gas footprint of 1 kWh consumed inside a given country.
 * The footprint is measured in gCO2eq (grams CO2 equivalent), meaning each greenhouse 
 * gas is converted to its CO2 equivalent in terms of global warming potential over 100 year 
 * (for instance, 1 gram of methane emitted has the same global warming impact during 100 years
 *  as ~34 grams of CO2 over the same period).
